# reddit

A repository for extracting data from reddit via the praw api. 

### Why?

I built this repository to store and leverage functions that can be used to analyze reddit posts. 
This could be useful for many potential applications including - acquiring data for ML models, quick information extraction, and sentiment analysis around a particular topic or brand.

### Projects/applications 
So far I have leverage this repo to complete one project: 

OMSCS reddit analysis:
I applied and was eventually accepted into [GA tech's online masters in computer science](https://omscs.gatech.edu/).
However, while I was (anxiously) waiting for my decision, I decided to analyze the reddit admissions thread for more information about how many people had been accepted / rejected and when the decisions were coming out. I then posted my analysis directly in the [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/p1fj9i/spring_2022_admissions_thread/) in order to share with other applicants who were waiting for their decisions. My post was well received and is currently the "Top" comment in the thread.
